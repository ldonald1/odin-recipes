        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana pancakes are pancakes that can be made with any pre-made, or hand-made, pancake mix, and
            some bananas. They are made by combining the wet ingredients for the pancake mix with mashed bananas,
            and then combining that mixture with the dry ingredients, resulting in the banana pancake batter! This
            batter is then cooked on a griddle over medium-high heat until golden brown.</p>

            <p>You can serve this with banana slices as a topping for extra presentation points!</p>
